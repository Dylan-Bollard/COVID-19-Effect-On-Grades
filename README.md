# COVID-19-Effect-On-Grades
Artificial dataset to satisfy graduate course requirement. 


---

This dataset was *generated* in order to fullfill a requirement for a graduate class in applied econometrics. I originally wanted to collect data on the effect of COVID-19 on student performance from a school district, but was unable to given that our local district was already conducting their own research. 

The set contains a panel dataset, meant to emulate 6 semesters/trimesters with the first three taking place before the COVID-19 lockdowns, and the final three coming after the lockdowns. It also contains a cross-sectional dataset that is meant to be a single semester/trimester after the COVID-19 lockdowns. Variables were included and manipulated to model real world trends, or local demographics in Portland Oregon. There is a full list of variables at the end of this markdown.

**It should be noted that student performance has *greatly* been diminished as a result of online education.**

Feel free to reach out about the Stata code. It ended up being about 1500 lines to generate and manipulate, but I'm happy to share it with the same Public Domain license.
