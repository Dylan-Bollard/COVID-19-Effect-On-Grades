# COVID-19-Effect-On-Grades
Artificial dataset to satisfy graduate course requirement. 


---

This dataset was *generated* in order to fullfill a requirement for a graduate class in applied econometrics. I originally wanted to collect data on the effect of COVID-19 on student performance from a school district, but was unable to given that our local district was already conducting their own research. 

The set contains a panel dataset, meant to emulate 6 semesters/trimesters with the first three taking place before the COVID-19 lockdowns, and the final three coming after the lockdowns. It also contains a cross-sectional dataset that is meant to be a single semester/trimester after the COVID-19 lockdowns. Variables were included and manipulated to model real world trends, or local demographics in Portland Oregon. There is a full list of variables at the end of this markdown.

**It should be noted that student performance has *greatly* been diminished as a result of online education.**

The Stata code was immense and I thought that it might prove to be interesting/helpful to someone else.
